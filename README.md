# Installation:
Read through the install script and run it with `sudo ./install`. (If you don't use sudo, the script cannot copy the bin folder. If this is not a problem for you then you can run it without sudo). 

# Keybindings:
Unless you somehow have my exact preferences, you will probably want to change the keybindings for these programs: 

~/.config/i3/config

~/.config/ranger/rc.conf

~/.config/musikcube/hotkeys.json

~/.vimrc
