# dotfiles
These are my configs.
# Installation:
Read through the install script and run it with `sudo ./install`. (If you don't use sudo, the script cannot copy the bin folder. If this is not a problem for you then you can run it without sudo). 

Unless you somehow have my exact preferences, you will probably want to change the keybindings for i3 and vim (~/.config/i3/config and .vimrc).
